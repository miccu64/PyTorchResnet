The task is to read carefully the famous landmark paper introducing ResNET:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf

and implement this network in a neat, parametrized way using subclassing API in Pytorch, so that different variants of this network can be instantiated based on the class call parameters choice.

Further, two instances are to be trained on GPU: Resnet 18 and 56 on the CIFAR 10 dataset (you must make necessary adjustments if needed).
